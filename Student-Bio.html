			<p>Hey there, my name is Paul. I'm 25, live in Raleigh, NC, and I'm currently a student at UNC Coding Boot Camp studying full stack web development. I graduated from NC State in December 2014 (Go Pack!) with a Bachelor's degree finance, but after working in the field for a few years I decided that I wanted a change of pace. After some consideratoin, I determined that web development best fits my interests. I'm excited to expand my coding knowledge and begin working on my new career path.</p>

			<p>My ideal landing spot for employment would be at a small firm or a start-up. A couple of my interests and hobbies outside of development include playing guitar, playing hockey, running, traveling, and listening to music. I'm a huge jam band fan - Phish, Grateful Dead, Moe. - it's all great to me. I love receiving new music recommendations too, so feel free to send some over! I'm also big into the NC beer scene, I'm all about craft breweries and keeping beer local. Thanks for reading!</p>
